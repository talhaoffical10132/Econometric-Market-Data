# Econometric-Market-Data
The dataset contains economic and market data about chicken consumption in the U.S. — things like how much chicken people eat each year, the prices of chicken and other meats, people’s income, and even temperature.  Your goal is to understand what factors drive chicken demand (that is, how many pounds of chicken people consume per person per year).
